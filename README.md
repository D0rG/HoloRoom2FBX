What was used:
  - Unity 2018.4.21
  - MRTK 2.4.0
  - Hololens 1 gen.
  - Magic
  - [UnityFBXExporter](https://github.com/KellanHiggins/UnityFBXExporter)
***
How to use it:
  - This only works with Unity XR remote right now.
  - After the Mesh appears, just click on the save button, and the save directory will be written to the log.
  - Blender doesn't take ASCII FBX files. You will need converting the ascii fbx in the binary fbx.

> I needed to scan the room to avoid constantly using unity remote. And it did what I needed it to do.
